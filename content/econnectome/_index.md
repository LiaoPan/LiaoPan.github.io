eConnectome (Electrophysiological Connectome) is an open-source MATLAB software package for imaging brain functional connectivity from electrophysiological signals. It provides interactive graphical interfaces for EEG/ECoG/MEG preprocessing, source estimation, connectivity analysis and visualization. Connectivity from EEG/ECoG/MEG can be mapped over sensor and source domains.
