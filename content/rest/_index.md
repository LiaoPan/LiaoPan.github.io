- 利用REST制作脑区Mask&提取脑区信号
- 计算reho、alff、falff、FC


REsting State fMRI data analysis Toolkit (REST) is a user-friendly convenient toolkit to calculate Functional Connectivity (FC), Regional Homogeneity (ReHo), Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF), Fractional ALFF (fALFF), Gragner causality and perform statistical analysis. You also can use REST to view your data, perform Monte Carlo simulation similar to AlphaSim in AFNI, calculate your images, regress out covariates, extract ROI time courses, reslice images, and sort DICOM files.
